# Image Deblurring App
**"Image Deblurring Using Deep Learning"** is a cutting-edge project that leverages a powerful stack of technologies to address the challenge of image debarring. Built with **Python** as the primary programming language and **Visual Studio Code** as the integrated development environment, this project offers a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI** for seamless interaction. Under the hood, it employs **PyTorch** as the deep learning framework and utilises image processing libraries like **OpenCV, Scikit-image, and Pillow** to enhance and restore blurred images with remarkable precision.

## Technology Stacks
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **User Interface**: Tkinter GUI
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Pytorch
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV, Scikit-image, and Pillow

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository into your local system
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aniru-dh21/Image-Deblurring-App.git
```
2. Open terminal and change the working directory to the following:
```bash
cd ./src 
```
3. To run the application first you have to train the model, so first run the following with the command;
```py
python deblur.py
```
4. After completion of execution, you can now test the application using the following command:
```py
python test.py
```
5. By running above command, Tkinter GUI window will open where you can pass the any blurred image to get an output of deblurred image.
